<p> What is Pokemon Go anyways?</p>
<p>Pokemon Go first released in 2016 and became an instant worldwide phenomenon. Nowadays, although the hype for the game has died, the game is flourishing with many new features. One of those features is PvP. Now you might be wondering, how do you battle other people on a phone game like Pokemon Go? 
The answer: Tap Tap Tap! Pokemon Go Pvp at its simplest is just a game where you tap your screen. However its many hidden complexities earn it a fitting comaprison between bullet chess. With matches lasting no more than 5 minutes and moves lasting from half a secon to 2 and a half seconds, it really is high intensity.</p>

<p> There are 2 ways to compete in Pokemon Go Pvp: GBl & S6P3. Gbl is a blind 3 format where your pokemon are unknown to your opponent up until they are actively sent into battle. On the other hand, S6P3 has the option to choose a potential 6 pokemon for 3 slots per battle. Both of these formats require different skillsets but it most high level players compete in both. There are multiple ranks in GBL ranging from rank 1 to 24 which reset every 2-3 months or season. The last 4 ranks show a score or "elo" and have specific names ranging from Ace at 2000 elo to Veteran at 2500 elo to Expert at 2750 elo and finally to Legend at 3000 elo. Ace is already an accomplishment for most but Legend is the highest level the game recognizes. Only out of all the Act, Veteran, Expert and Legend players, only the top 4% of these players reach Legend. The necessary skill and dedication to reach such a rank is great but Jello has reached it consistently for 9 straight seasons. </p>

  <p> Gbl is the easier format to play as it takes less time, coordination and effort. However the highest level of GBL is where the best players play each other repeatedly in constantly heated games. The top 500 players are placed on a leaderboard each day. Jello has placed at a peak of 4th in the world which was also #1 in North America. He has also had multiple appearances in the top 10 of the leaderboard. Below are a couple of websites that track Leaderboard placement: </p>

<p>Jello has also accomplished much when it comes to S6P3. The most popular format for S6P3 is called factions. Factions is a team based competition where a team of 12 total players play 21 total matches across 7 players each week. First team to 11 wins is the victor of the week. Jello has played over 60 weeks totaling to over 180 games while maintaing around a 65% winrate. At the time of writing Jello currently plays for  <a href="">link text</a>
